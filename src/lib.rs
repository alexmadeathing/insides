//! A compact, high performance space filling curve library for Rust.
//! 
//! TODO Write intro
//! 
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use insides::*;
//! 
//! let xyz = [1, 2, 3];
//! 
//! // Create a 3D morton location using u16 coordinate indices
//! // At the moment, we have to specify the number of dimensions twice, sorry!
//! // (this will change with improvements to Rust const generics)
//! let location = Morton::<Expand<u16, 3>, 3>::from_coords(xyz);
//! 
//! // Access raw morton location index
//! // Useful as a map key or array index!
//! // In this case, we're using a morton curve, so we know the underlying bit
//! // layout. If we used a different type of curve, the index would be
//! // different.
//! assert_eq!(location.index(), 0b110101);
//! 
//! // Get neighbour in the negative X axis
//! let neighbour_a = location.neighbour_on_axis(0, QueryDirection::Negative);
//! assert_eq!(neighbour_a.coords(), [0, 2, 3]);
//! 
//! // Get neighbour in the positive Y axis
//! let neighbour_b = location.neighbour_on_axis(1, QueryDirection::Positive);
//! assert_eq!(neighbour_b.coords(), [1, 3, 3]);
//! 
//! // Get sibling on Z axis
//! // Its use is subtle and may not be apparent at first glance. Imagine the
//! // world is divided into a grid where each cell contains 8 siblings (in the
//! // 3D case). This method operates upon that grid. This is mostly useful
//! // when applied to tree-like structures.
//! let sibling_a = location.sibling_on_axis(2);
//! assert_eq!(sibling_a.coords(), [1, 2, 2]);
//! 
//! // Calling again from the sibling gets our original location
//! let sibling_b = sibling_a.sibling_on_axis(2);
//! assert_eq!(sibling_b, location);
//! 
//! // This gets, either the sibling, or the same location, on the Z axis,
//! // depending on which is further in the query direction.
//! // This is useful when you want to find the locations on one edge of a cell.
//! let sibling_or_same = location.sibling_or_same_on_axis(2, QueryDirection::Positive);
//! assert_eq!(sibling_or_same.coords(), [1, 2, 3]);
